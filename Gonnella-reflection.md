* I was struggling with branches mostly and how they interact with the master.
* Branches were clarified, merge conflicts were clarified, also navigating a repo from a clone was clarified.
* I asked my a few questions. One related to branches and whether they pointed to same commit as master immediately after creation. The other question was about relative paths. 
* I know how to use and navigate git. But honestly I'm still a confused about how the bare-bones software actually works.
* It was great first GPS experience. I was nervous coming in and our guide immediately made me feel more comfortable. I enjoyed working with my partner and I thought our guide was extremely helpful both with the coding and creating a productive(non-stressed) atmosphere.
