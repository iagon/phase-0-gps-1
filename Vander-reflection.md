#Reflection

1. The main thing that confused me was why we clone a repo and then also create branches in our local workspace. I didn't fully understand why we had to create a branch instead of just working directly on the master branch and pushing those changes up.

2. This concept was clarified for me and now I understand how branching keeps everything organized and how without it there would be chaos when people pushed their changes to GitHub.

3. Most of the questions asked were related to syntax. My pair also helped be clarify what a fetch and merge is and how it's like a pull. I also asked a couple of questions related the concept I discussed above.

4. There's nothing I can think of right now that confuses me, but I know as use it more there might be some new features that I'll have to learn. 

5. I had a great experience with my pair and my guide. In the basic programming that I've taught myself in the past I never had to work with others on assignments. This made me a little nervous going into this GPS but it went incredibly well and it's eased my mind about future pairings.
